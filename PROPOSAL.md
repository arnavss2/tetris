# **Tetris**

## _Project Description_

For my final project, I want to build a C++ application that leverages Cinder to recreate Tetris. Tetris is a tile-matching video game created by Russian software engineer Alexey Pajitnov in 1984. In Tetris, players complete lines by moving differently shaped pieces (tetrominoes), which descend onto the playing field. The completed lines disappear and grant the player points, and the player can fill the vacated spaces. The game ends when the playing field is filled. The longer the player can delay this inevitable outcome, the higher their score will be.

## _Motivation & Background_

I want to do this project because playing Tetris is a fond memory from my childhood. Therefore, I am motivated to reveal the inner workings of this simplistic yet sophisticated software that would give me immense pleasure. 

Concerning my background knowledge related to this project, we have worked with both game engines and Cinder in various assignments for CS 126.

## _Weekly Timeline_

- Week 1: I will be implementing the basic functioning of Tetris with a single block being rendered on the screen. I will use Cinder for designing different blocks and their positions on the display. I will also implement key events for rotating, moving and bringing down the tetromino. 

- Week 2: I will allow multiple tetrominoes to be rendered one after the other in random order and allow them to stack on top of one another and break lines. I will be calculating the score and displaying it. I will also show the block to be generated next and the number of lines destroyed. I will also implement high-score records for the game. 

- Week 3: I will add sound effects to my game. I will also improve the GUI for a more interactive game. 

## _Extra Effects_

If I were to finish the project early, I will implement saving an ongoing game into a file and loading it from the file. I would add different difficulty levels for the game. For games with increasing difficulty, complex blocks will be generated more than linear blocks.
